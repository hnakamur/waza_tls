waza_tls
========

waza_tls is an experimental TLS library written in Zig.

This project is meant for me to learn Zig and TLS.
I'm not a security expert and this library is not meant for production use.

## steps to generate keys, self-signed certificates, self-signed CA for tests

### `tests/rsa2048.{crt,key}.pem`

Install OpenSSL CLI and run the following command:

```
./create_rsa2048_self_signed_cert.sh
```

### `tests/p256-self-signed.{crt,key}.pem`

Install OpenSSL CLI and run the following command:

```
./create_p256_self_signed_cert.sh
```

### `tests/client_cert/my-root-ca.{crt,key}` and `tests/client_cert/my-client.{crt,key}`

Install [smallstep/cli: ðŸ§° A zero trust swiss army knife for working with X509, OAuth, JWT, OATH OTP, etc.](https://github.com/smallstep/cli) with the steps described at [Installation](https://github.com/smallstep/cli#installation).

Then run the following command:

```
(cd tests/client_cert; ./gen_ca_and_cert.sh)
```

## Run tests

```
